\section{Introduction}

Superframes is an annotation scheme for semantic roles. It has the following goals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lexicon-free annotation:} With fine-grained schemes like FrameNet \citep{baker-etal-1998-berkeley-framenet} or PropBank \citep{palmer-etal-2005-proposition}, annotators have to constantly look up which frames exist and which roles are defined for them. Lexicons are also perennially incomplete, and the process of extending them is complicated. Superframes defines only a small number of coarse-grained frames with the aim of making annotation quick and easy across all languages and domains, and to minimize role divergence even in the absence of a lexicon.
    \item \textbf{Obvious role choices through framing:} In semantic role inventories in the VerbNet tradition \citep{kipper-schuler-2005-verbnet}, roles are semantically defined only vaguely and ambiguously. For example, the subject of the English verb \emph{watch} can be described as an Agent as well as an Experiencer. Prior approaches to resolving this ambiguity involve the creation of a lexicon (see above) or giving up on the idea of categorial role labels altogether \citep{white-etal-2016-universal}. The Superframes approach is to proceed in two steps: first pick the most fitting superframe for each predicate, then the core roles are clearly defined. Additional argument roles are handled via mixin roles (see below).
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive annotation with a unified vocabulary}: Superframes is a comprehensive and unified inventory of coarse semantic roles applicable to all types of morphosyntactic dependencies between content words, including modifier relations, compound relations, state argument relations, process argument relations, event argument relations, discourse relations, etc. It is designed to be annotated on top of existing morphosyntactic dependency graphs \citep[e.g., Universal Dependencies; ][]{de-marneffe-etal-2021-universal}. This has the advantage that the markables are pre-identified and that an explicit annotation of the morphosyntax-semantics interface results.
    \item \textbf{Ambiguity tolerance:} not all ambiguities in choosing a superframe can be resolved. Superframes embraces data perspectivism \citep{basile-2020-end} and encourages annotators to annotate multiple possibilities, in particular in the case of metaphorical language.
    \item \textbf{Fine-grained comparisons:} By virtue of being annotated atop syntactic dependencies, Superframes target the syntax-semantics interface and enable cross-linguistic studies that go beyond comparisons of meaning representations like AMR \citep{banarescu-etal-2013-abstract}.
\end{enumerate}

    \label{tab:inventory}
\end{table}

The Superframes annotation scheme is based on the binary relations shown in Table~\ref{tab:inventory}. Borrowing terminology from AMR, we call the first relate the ``domain'' and the second relate the ``range''. This inventory is then used to annotate bilexical dependencies with roles. We distinguish a number of types of roles, as explained in the following.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Role Type I: Modifier Roles}

Modifier dependencies are annotated with a plain binary relation or its inverse (denoted by \textsf{-of}, as in AMR). This applies equally to verb, noun, and other modifiers.

\ex. \a. \dep{*partied* at home_loc}
     \b. \dep{a *man* with a mustache_pwh-of}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Role Type II: Core Argument Roles}

Predicates such as verbs (but also adjectives, state/process/event nouns, relational nouns, etc.) evoke their own superframe. The core arguments are those that correspond to the domain and the range, respectively. We denote them by the suffixes \textsf{d} and \textsf{r}, respectively.

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_locd *went* to Boston_locr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_pssr *owns* a house_pssd}

The first example illustrates that Superframes abstract away from aktionsart: it does not matter for the choice of superframe or roles whether a state (Kim is in Boston), an event bringing that state about (Kim went to Boston), or a process (Kim is walking) is described. Borrowing terminology from UCCA \citep{abend-rappoport-2013-universal}, we collectively call states, processes, and events ``scenes''.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Role Type IIa: Initial and Intermediate Range Roles}

However, some predicates denote the dissolution of a relation between a domain and an initial range, and the establishment of the domain and a new range. To distinguish the initial from the final range, we use the prefix \textsf{ir} instead of \textsf{r} for it. Likewise, we use \textsf{mr} for intermediate ranges.

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_locd *went* from Chicago_locir via Pittsburg_locmr to Boston_locr}\\
     \b. \dep{Kim_pssir *kept* the house_pssd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_pssir *lost* the house_pssd}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Role Type III: Non-core Argument Roles}

Some predicates have more than just the domain and range arguments. For such arguments, annotators should choose the binary relation that describes the relation between the scene and the argument best, and prefix it with \textsf{x} to distinguish it from a modifier. Particularly frequent non-core roles are \textsf{xcau}, \textsf{xsnd}, and \textsf{xrcp}.

\ex. \a. \dep{Sandy_xcau *brought* Kim_locd to Boston_locr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *talked* about Sandy_msgd}\\
     \b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *saw* Sandy_msgd swim_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *searched* the woods_xloc for Sandy_msgd}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{General Guidelines for Framing}

Part of the annotation task is to choose a superframe for each instance of a
predicate. In choosing a superframe, keep in mind \emph{implicit arguments},
i.e., arguments that are part of the syntactic frame of the predicate but not
realized in the present instance.  For example, the superframe chosen in
\ref{ex:implicit1}, \ref{ex:implicit2}, and \ref{ex:implicit3} may not be
obvious unless you consider the implicit arguments, which are explicit in
\ref{ex:explicit1}, \ref{ex:explicit2}, and \ref{ex:explicit3}.

\ex.
\a. \label{ex:implicit1}  \dep{Kim_xcau *used* a hammer_msnr}
\b. \label{ex:explicit1} \dep{Kim_xcau *used* a hammer_msnr to smash_mnsd the vase}

\ex.
\a. \label{ex:implicit2}  \dep{Kim_xcau *reacted* to the news_caur}
\b. \label{ex:explicit2} \dep{Kim_xcau *reacted* to the news_caur with sadness_caud}

\ex.
\a. \label{ex:implicit3}  \dep{Kim_xcau *helped* Sandy_pcpd}
\b. \label{ex:explicit3} \dep{Kim_xcau *helped* Sandy_pcpd clean_pcpr the dishes}

Likewise, \emph{shadow} and \emph{default} arguments should be considered when
choosing a superframe.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xcau *deboned* the fish_pwhir} (\textsf{pwh}, not \textsf{pcp})
\b. \dep{Kim_locir *sneezed*} (\textsf{loc}, not \textsf{pcp})
\b. \dep{Our local supermarket_xcau *delivers*} (\textsf{loc}, not \textsf{pcp})

A participant whose syntactic argument position is occupied should not be
treated like an implicit argument. For example, consider \ref{ex:occupied1}.
Here, \emph{The knife} occupies the subject position and should be treated as
the causer of the cutting. We could add the person handling the knife as the
causer, and treat the knife as an instrument. However, for this we would not
merely have to realize another argument, but change the syntactic argument
structure so that the subject position goes to that causer, as in
\ref{ex:displaced1}. Thus, we treat this as a different framing with a
different causer, rather than a more explicit version of the same framing.
Likewise, \ref{ex:occupied2} and \ref{ex:displaced2} are two different framings, one with
\emph{price} as the \textsf{pcpd}, and one with \emph{butter}.

\ex.
\a. \label{ex:occupied1} \dep{The knife_xcau *cut* the butter_pcpd}
\b. \label{ex:displaced1} \dep{Kim_xcau *cut* the butter_pcpd with the knife_ins}

\ex.
\a. \label{ex:occupied2} \dep{The price_pcpd is *high*}
\b. \label{ex:displaced2} \dep{The butter_pcpd is *high* in price_att}

When in doubt, try to treat different syntactic frames of the same predicate
consistently.  For example, in \ref{ex:chase-caused} \emph{chase} could be
framed as caused motion (with Kim as an \textsf{xcau}) or as accompanied motion
(with Kim as an \textsf{xacc}). Because the latter works for other syntactic
frames of \emph{chase} as well, as in \ref{ex:chase-accompanied}, prefer it.

\ex.
\a. \label{ex:chase-caused} \dep{Kim_xacc *chased* Sandy_locd around the block_locmr}
\b. \label{ex:chase-accompanied} \dep{Kim_xacc *chased* after Sandy_locd}

Prefer core roles over non-core roles. For example, if the subject is both the
causer and the final possessor in a scene, choose \textsf{pssr} over
\textsf{xcau}.

\ex. \a. \dep{They_pssr *plundered* Rome_pssir}
     \b. \dep{Kim_locir *undressed*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Handling Control Constructions}

In control construction, a predicate has an argument or modifier that is not
its child (but rather a sibling or something else) in the syntactic dependency
tree. This necessitates an additional arc on which to do the role labeling.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xsnd__locd *promised* Sandy_xrcp to **come**_msgr} (subject control verb)
\b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *persuaded* Sandy_xrcp__locd to **come**_msgr} (object control verb)
\b. \dep{Kim_msgd__locd *seemed* to **fly**_msgr} (raising)
\b. \dep{Kim_locd__xsnd *entered* the room_locr **singing**_dpc} (depictive)
\b. \dep{You_xsnd 're *talking* me_xrsd__xrcp **silly**_xrsr} (resultative)
\b. \dep{Kim_locd__locd has *come* to **stay**_xpl} (subjectless adverbial clause)
\b. \dep{Kim_locd__xcau *left* after **trashing**_tmp the room__pcp} (subjectless adverbial clause)
\b. \dep{Kim_pcpd__msgd is *hard* to **love**_pcpr} (\emph{tough} construction)
\b. \dep{*Kim*__xcau , who **broke**_scn the vase__pcpd , is sorry} (relative clause)
\b. \dep{the *question*__msgd___msgd we__xsnd___xsnd **raised**_scn without ***answering***} (parasitic gap)

TODO: addtional relations for acc, att?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Dual Framing}

If you are not sure which framing fits better, annotate both.

\ex.
\begin{dependency}
\begin{deptext}
    Kim \& refused \& to \& eat \\
\end{deptext}
\depedge[edge height=\baselineskip]{2}{1}{xsnd}
\depedge[edge height=\baselineskip]{2}{4}{msgd}
\depedge[edge below,edge height=\baselineskip]{2}{1}{pcpd:locr}
\depedge[edge below,edge height=\baselineskip]{2}{4}{pcpr}
\end{dependency}

Likewise, if both a literal and a metaphorical meaning are accessible to you,
annotate both.

\ex.
\begin{dependency}
\begin{deptext}
    A \& hush \& passed \& over \& the \& group \\
\end{deptext}
\depedge[edge height=\baselineskip]{3}{2}{locd}
\depedge[edge height=\baselineskip]{3}{6}{locmr}
\depedge[edge below,edge height=\baselineskip]{3}{2}{pcpr}
\depedge[edge below,edge height=\baselineskip]{3}{6}{pcpd:xsnd}
\end{dependency}

\section{Superframe Relations}

\subsection{Accompaniment (\textsf{acc})}
\label{sec:acc}

The \textsf{accd} and the \textsf{accr} appear together, more or less symmetrically.

\ex.
\a. \dep{*chicken* with rice_acc}
\b. \dep{The chicken_accd *comes* with rice_accr}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *added* rice_accr to the chicken_accd}

Can also be used for scenes unfolding in close connection.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Rolling thunder_accr *accompanies* the rain_accd}
\b. \dep{Man_locd durfte das Gelände_locr nur_dim unter Aufsicht_acc *betreten*}

Often, the accompanier denotes not a scene but an entity participating in it,
and must be metonymically understood as the scene.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_locd *cycled* to Rome_locr with Sandy_acc}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd *danced* with Sandy_xacc}
\b. \dep{Kim_xacc *chased* Sandy_locd around the block_locmr}
\b. \dep{Kim_accr *accompanied* Sandy_accd}
\b. \dep{Kim_accr *accompanied* Sandy_accd on the piano_xmns}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Asset (\textsf{ast})}
\label{sec:ast}

Entity given or offered in an exchange or wager.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_pssr *bought* the house_pssd for a million dollars_xast}
\b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *offered* Sandy_xrcp a million dollars_msgr for the house_xast}
\b. \dep{I_xsnd *bet* you_xrcp 30 bucks_xast to an apple_xcmp he will win_msgr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Causer (\textsf{cau})}
\label{sec:cau}

Entity causing a scene.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xcau *broke* the glass_pcpd}
\b. \dep{The knife_xcau *cut* the bread_pcpd}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *cut* the bread_pcpd with a knife_mns}
\b. \dep{The war_caur *caused* a famine_caud}
\b. \dep{There *was* a famine because of the war_cau}
\b. \dep{Der Wasserdruck_pcpd *stieg* , wodurch der Brunnen überfloss_cau-of}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd *went* to town_locr because they wanted_cau to buy food}

Note how the last example expresses a purpose, but construes it as a cause, so
\textsf{cau} is the right relation to use. Compare this to construal as a
purpose:

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_locd__pssr *went* to town_locr to **buy**_xpl food}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Comparison (\textsf{cmp})}
\label{sec:cmp}

\textsf{cmpd} is compared with or in some other way described in reference to
\textsf{cmpr}. Used to contrast scenes:

\ex.
\a. \dep{Compared_cmp to Sandy, Kim_pcpd is *tall*}
\b. \dep{Sandy_pcpd is *short* whereas Kim is tall_cmp}
\b. \dep{They_xsnd *demonize* the left_msgd while doing_cmp nothing about the right}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd *went* out despite the rain_cmp}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd *came* although Sandy had told_cmp them not to}
\b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *sent* Sandy_xrcp a letter_msgr , but it never arrived_cmp}

Or to compare other entities:

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_cmpd *outranks* Sandy_cmpr}
\b. \dep{Kim_cmpd *exceeds* Sandy_cmpr in height_xatt}
\b. \dep{The Polish restaurant_cmpd *compared* favorably_xmnr to the Spanish one_cmpr}
\b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *compared* Coke_pcpd to Pepsi_pcpr}

The comparative of adjectives is treated as a valency-changing operation that
gives the adjective an additional \textsf{xcmp} argument:

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_pcpd is *taller* than Sandy_xcmp}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Location (\textsf{loc})}
\label{sec:loc}

Describes the location (or change of location, i.e., motion) of the
\textsf{locd}.

\ex.
\a. \dep{The *hat* in the box_loc}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd *lives* in Boston_locr}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd *went* from the living room_locir through the door_locmr into the kitchen_locr}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *placed* the hat_locd on the table_locr}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd is *running*}
\b. \dep{Kim_locd is *dancing* around the room_locmr with Sandy_xacc}

\subsubsection{Wrapping and Wearing}

The item wrapping or being worn by something is construed as the \textsf{locd}.

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_locr is *wearing* a shirt_locd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_locr is *wearing* glasses_locd}
     \b. \dep{The shroud_locd *wraps* the scepter_locr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_locr *put* on a sweater_locd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_locir *took* off their glasses_locd}

\subsubsection{Ingestion and Excretion}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_locr *ate* an apple_locd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_locr *nibbled* on the pretzel_locd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_locir *threw* up the apple_locd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_locir *sneezed*}

\subsubsection{Embellishment and Tarnishment}

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xcau *decorated* the balcony_locr with fairy lights_locd}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *splashed* Sandy_locr with water_locd}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *washed* the dirt_locd off Sandy_locir}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *washed* Sandy_locir}

\subsubsection{Hitting}

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xcau *hit* Sandy_locr}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *hit* Sandy_locr with a stick_locd}
\b. \dep{The stick_locd *hit* Sandy_locr}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *hit* Sandy_locr on the head_xatt with a pool noodle_locd}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *kicked* Sandy_locr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Manner (\textsf{mnr})}
\label{sec:mnr}

Manner in which a scene unfolds.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xsnd *sang* softly_mnr}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *placed* the note_locd surreptitiously_mnr on the counter_locr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Means (\textsf{mns})}
\label{sec:mns}

Intermediary between the causer and a scene; instrument or second scene through
which the causer causes the first scene.

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xcau *cut* the cake_pcpd with a knife_mns}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *painted* the room_locr by exploding_mns a paint bomb}
\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *used* a pen_mnsr to get_mnsd the lid off}
\b. \dep{You_xcau *used* me_mnsd !}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Message (\textsf{msg})}
\label{sec:msg}

A message is expressed or received, where \textsf{msgd} is what the message is
about, and \textsf{msgr} is the message itself, or its contents. Often used
together with \textsf{xsnd} (sender) and \textsf{xrcp} (recipient).

\subsubsection{Expression}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xsnd *yelped*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *said* : it 's fine_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *said* it was fine_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *called* Sandy_msgd__pcpd a **liar**_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *told* Sandy_xrcp a secret_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *talked* about Sandy_msgd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *talked* shit_msgr about Sandy_msgd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd and Sandy *conversed*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *conversed* with Sandy_xacc}

\subsubsection{Gesture}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xsnd *curtseyed* to the Queen_xrcp}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *shook* their head_cpd no_msgr}

\subsubsection{Performance}

Performing a work of art is framed as expression where the work of art is the
\textsf{msgd}.

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xsnd *played* a little tune_msgd on their tuba_xmns}
     \b. \dep{They_xsnd *performed* the play_msgd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *sang* a song_msgd}

\subsubsection{Depiction}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xsnd *drew* a heron_msgd}
     \b. \dep{a *picture* of the heron_msgd}

When the object is the resulting work of art, frame it as creation (\textsf{pcp}) instead:

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xcau *drew* a picture_pcpd}

\subsubsection{Recording}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xsnd *wrote* Sandy_xrcp a letter_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *wrote* the message_msgr__pcp-of onto a piece of paper_xloc with a pen_mns in big red **letters**_xdpc}
     \b. \dep{The concert_msgd was *recorded* on tape_xloc}

\subsubsection{Perception}

Perception, including mental and volitional perception.

     \b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *wants* Sandy_msgd__locd to **swim**_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_msgd__xrcp *seems* **happy**_msgr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_msgd__xrcp *seems* **happy**_msgr to Sandy_xrcp}
     \b. \dep{The Thought Police_xrcp *observed* Winston_msgd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *studies* linguistics_msgd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *taught* Sandy_xrcp Spanish_msgd}
     \b. \dep{Sandy is a *professor* of linguistics_msgd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *measured* the elasticity_msgd}
     \b. \dep{The jury_xrcp *found* Kim_msgd__pcpd **guilty**_msgr}

\subsection{Participation (\textsf{pcp})}
\label{sec:pcp}

\textsf{pcpd} is the single core participant of a scene specified by the
predicate, or a participant in a scene specified by the \textsf{pcpr}.

\subsubsection{States and Properties}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_pcpd is *tall*}
     \b. \dep{The painting_pcpd *improved*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *improved* the painting_pcpd}

\subsubsection{Kinds}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_pcpd is a *painter*}
     \b. \dep{Thag dog_pcpd is a *labrador*}

\subsubsection{Activities}

``Activities'' are events with a single core participant that can be
characterized as actively participating in the event.

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_pcpd *partied*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_pcpd *partied* with Sandy_acc}
     \b. \dep{Kim_pcpd *had* sex_cpd with Sandy_xacc}

\subsubsection{Experiences}

``Experiences'' are events with a single core participant that can be
characterized as undergoing the event.

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xcau *attacked* Sandy_pcpd}
     \b. \dep{They_xcau *played* you_pcpd like a fool_cmp}
     \b. \dep{Kim_pcpd *needs* Sandy_pcpr}

In the last example, understand \emph{Sandy} to metonymically stand for a scene,
e.g. one of Sandy helping Kim.

\subsubsection{Transformation and Creation}

\textsf{pcpd} denotes the entity undergoing the transformation, and
\textsf{pcpr} denotes its new state. Creation is framed as transformation of
some material (\textsf{pcpd}, often unrealized) into the newly created entity
(\textsf{pcpr}).

\ex. \a. \dep{The ice_pcpd *turned* into water_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{God_xcau *made* people_pcpr out of clay_pcpd}
     \b. \dep{A rock_pcpr *formed*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *created* a work_pcpr of art}

\subsubsection{Reproduction}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xcau *copied* the book_pcpd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *translated* the book_pcpd to German_pcpr}

\subsubsection{Destruction}

\ex. \a. \dep{The vase_pcpd *broke*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *broke* the vase_pcpd}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *killed* Sandy_pcpd}
     \b. \dep{Sandy_pcpd *died*}

%\subsubsection{Auxilary Verbs and Copulas}
%
%Auxiliary verbs, when annotating on top of SUD rather than UD, also fall under
%\textsf{pcp}.
%
%\ex. \dep{We_pcpd *will* see_pcpr}
%     \dep{*Have* you_pcpd eaten_pcpr ?}
%     \dep{Kim_pcpd *must* go_pcpr}
%     \dep{Kim_pcpd *did* not go_pcpr}
%     \dep{Kim_pcpd *is* a champion_pcpr}
%     \dep{Kim_pcpd *is* tall_pcpr}

\subsubsection{Phase}

The scene starting, continuing, ending, etc., is always the range. Only use
\textsf{pcpd} if the predicate has a separate argument for a participant in the
scene.

\ex. \a. \dep{The wound_pcpd__pcpd *began* to **heal**_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{A commotion_pcpr *started*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *started* a commotion_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{The concert_pcpir *ended*}
     \b. \dep{The concert_pcpir *continued*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *interrupted* the session_pcpir}
     \b. \dep{The storm_pcpir *ebbed*}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *calmed* the commotion_pcpir}

\subsubsection{Causation}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xcau *let* Sandy_pcpd__socd **join**_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *made* Sandy_pcpd__socd **join**_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *allowed* Sandy_pcpd__socd to **join**_pcpr}

\subsubsection{Prevention}

\ex. \a. \dep{Kim_xcau *kept* Sandy_pcpd__socd from **joining**_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{Swift action_xcau *prevented* an outbreak_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_pcpd__locd *refrained* from **going**_pcpr}
     \b. \dep{Kim_xcau *saved* Sandy_pcpd from the dragon_pcpr}

In the last example, understand \emph{dragon} metonymically as a scene in which
the dragon causes harm to Sandy.

\subsubsection{Predicate Modifiers}

Modifiers that are themselves predicates which assign the modified entity a
role, such as adjectives or relative clauses, use the \textsf{pcp} relation.
\ex.
\a. \dep{a *package*__pcpd that was **heavy**_pcp}
\b. \dep{a **heavy**_pcp *package*__pcpd}

\subsubsection{Assignment}

The participation relation is also used for the assignment of names,
identifiers, tasks, or abstract assignment of other entities to entities.

\ex.
\a. \dep{The baby_pcpd was *named* Kim_pcpr}
\b. \dep{*Hangar* \#3_pcp is empty}
\b. \dep{The teacher_xcau *assigned* each student_pcpd a task_pcpr}
\b. \dep{Is that Peter_pcp-of 's *chair* ?}

types of mismatches between syntactic and semantic predicate-argument
structure.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clearpage
\subsection{Complex Predicate (\textsf{cpd})}
\label{sec:cpd}

If a predicate together with one or more of its syntactic arguments forms a
complex predicate, those syntactic dependencies are labeled \textsf{cpd}.

\subsubsection{Light Verbs}

\ex.
\a. \dep{Kim_xsnd *gave* a lecture_cpd}

\clearpage
\subsection{Expletive (\textsf{exp})}
\label{sec:exp}

Used for expletive pronouns and pronominal adverbs that fill in for a
dislocated clause. Not used for weather pronouns and expletive \emph{there},

\subsection{Resultative (\textsf{rsd}, \textsf{rsr})}
\label{sec:rsd}\label{sec:rsr}

\textsf{rsr}. If that participant is not assigned a role by the primary
predicate, use \textsf{rsd} instead.

%\section{Difficult Cases}
%
%Verbs with scene arguments, often control constructions
%
%Guideline: keep number of x-roles small; focus on non-subjects
%
%\ex.
%\a. \dep{Kim_xcau *used* a hammer_mnsr to smash_mnsd the vase}
%\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *reacted* to the attack_caur with a drone strike_caud}
%\b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *managed* with dealing_sncr the cards}
%\b. \dep{Kim_accr *accompanied* Sandy_accd on the piano_xmns}

%\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *helped* Sandy_pcpd clean_pcpr}
%\b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *needs* Sandy_pcpd to take_pcpr a stand}
%\b. \dep{Kim_xrcp *needs* Sandy_pcpr}
%\b. \dep{Kim_pcpd *deserves* to be treated_pcpr with respect}
%\b. \dep{Kim_xcau *began* the party_pwhr with a speech_pwhd}
%
%Functor head constructions
%
%\ex. \a. \dep{You_cmpd are *more* of a dancer_xnuc?? than she is_cmpr}
%
%Neither subject nor object have a core role:
%
%\ex. \a. \dep{It_exp *rains*} (pcp)
%     \b. \dep{Kim_xsnd *plays* the flute_mns} (msg)
%     \c. \dep{Kim_xcau *paints*} (pcp?)
%
%Should we force some metonymy to force an overt core role? E.g., have \emph{flute} stand for the msgr?
%
%I need you.
%
%He responded to the provocation with violence.
%
%He began the party with a speech.
%
%Spend money/time on something
%
%Deserve
%
%Socially constructed properties like names, prices: name the ship, it costs 1M, our story on that is not yet clear
%
%How does our terminology relate to Croft's?
%
%reference = n/a, because references don't have roles
%
%modification = modifier roles
%
%predication = argument roles
%
%action = subdistinguished by relation
%
%property/object = a distinction we do not make
%
%But where do binary states like possession fit into Croft's scheme?
%
%Explicit distinctions we stay away from for now, many additional complexities
%trying to pin them down:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item state vs. process vs. event, or really any aspectual information that
%        is not strictly required because of source/path/goal-like arguments.
%        Thus: \dep{Kim_xcau *paints*}.
%    \item state vs. property vs. object predication
%\end{itemize}
%
%Tamm: adnominal possession (not restricted to possession strictu sensu) where
%the head's referent is typically identified via the possessor's referent,
%e.g.,: Peter's chair (location/temporary possession/assignment)/brother
%(social)/book (creator)/house (location/possession)/finger (part) vs.
%non-anchoring relations (typification): golden ring (material)/coffee cup
%(container-contained/purpose)/autumn flower (temporal).
%
%We need to say something about relational nouns:
%
%\dep{my_pcpr *creator*}
%
%Subevents/context:
%
%Das Betreten ist nur in Begleitung gestattet
%
%Frida begleitete Hans auf dem Klavier

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\section{Motivation}
%
%Why Superframes?
%
%See motivation introduction.
%
%AMR: try to abstract away from superficial differences (unsuccessfully, see work on divergences). E.g., focus is not necessarily placed at predicate associated with syntactic root of sentence.
%
%Superframes: use dependency tree as a scaffold, annotate syntax-semantic interface rather than ``the'' semantics directly.

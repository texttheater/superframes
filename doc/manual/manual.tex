    \label{tab:superframes}
\end{table}

Superframes is an annotation scheme for semantic roles. Like other such
schemes, it is essentially about pinning down, in a machine-readable form,
``who did what to whom''. It is different from other such schemes, such as
FrameNet \citep{baker-etal-1998-berkeley}, VerbNet
\citep{kipper-schuler-2005-verbnet}, PropBank
\citep{palmer-etal-2005-proposition}, VerbAtlas
\citep{di-fabio-etal-2019-verbatlas}, or WiSER \citep{feng-etal-2022-widely} in
a number of ways. It aims to avoid a number of practical problems in annotating
with those schemes. Here's how Superframes annotation works, in a nutshell:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every content word (verb, noun, pronoun, adjective, or adverb) is a
        \emph{predicate}. Every predicate evokes one of a few dozen
        \emph{superframes}, which determines its coarse semantic class and the
        possible role labels for its arguments.
    \item The syntactic \emph{dependents} of a predicate can be
        \emph{core arguments}, in which case they get one of the role labels
        defined by the superframe of the predicate, or \emph{external
        arguments} or \emph{modifiers}, in which case they are treated as
        evoking their own frame in which the predicate serves as a core argument.
    \item There are only two main core role labels per superframe.
    \item For predicates denoting change (or lack thereof) over time,
        some superframes have \emph{aspectual variants} with role variants that
        allow to distinguish participants before, during, and after an event.
        This avoids having \texttt{Source} and \texttt{Target} as roles in
        their own right, which indicate the time sequence but suppress
        information about the nature of the relation that is changing.
        %like \texttt{-CHANGE},
        %\texttt{-INTRO}, \texttt{-EXTRO}, \texttt{-PREEMPTION},
        %\texttt{-CONTINUATION}, \texttt{-PROCESS}, \texttt{-HABIT},
        %\texttt{-NECESSITY}, and \texttt{-POSSIBILITY}
    \item Similarly, Superframes do not have the \texttt{Agent} role, which is
        often in conflict with roles indicating more specifically the agent's
        relation to other participants.
    \item Doubt, ambiguity, and figurativity are systematically treated. If there
        is not one clear solution, the solution is to give two or more
        alternative labels.
\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{tab:superframes} shows the superframes and their roles.

\subsection{Core Arguments}

The most prototypical predicate is a verb, and the simplest case is a verb with only one argument. It can for example denote an experience or an activity:

\ex.\dep{Kim_experiencer is *sleeping#EXPERIENCE*}

\ex.\dep{Kim_is-active is *partying#ACTIVITY*}

With two core arguments, a verb denotes a relation that holds between them:

\ex.\dep{Kim_possessor *owns#POSSESSION* a house_possession}

\ex.\dep{The house_possession *belongs#POSSESSION* to Kim_possessor}

\ex.\dep{Kim_topic *seems#MESSAGE* happy_content}

\subsection{Aspect and Mode}
\label{sec:aspect-mode}

Rather than a static relationship between two entities, many verbs (and other
predicates) denote a change (or absence of change) in such a relationship. We
sort such predicates into a few coarse aspectual classes. For example,
initiation (\frs{-INIT}) means a state is begun or worked towards, deinitiation
(\frs{-DEINIT}) means a state is ended, completed, or its end is worked
towards, change (\frs{-CHANGE}) combines both, where one state is replaced by
another, continuation (\frs{-CONT}) means a state persists or is even
intensified, and prevention (\frs{-PREV}) means it fails to begin.
Accordingly, roles with prefix \rl{target-}, \rl{initial-}, or \rl{transitory-}
mark participants at/beyond the end of, at the beginning of, or at some point
during the event, respectively.

\ex.\dep{Kim_target-possessor *got#POSSESSION-INIT* the house_possession}

\ex.\dep{Kim_initial-possessor *lost#POSSESSION-DEINIT* the house_posesssion}

\ex.\dep{Kim_initial-possessor *sold#POSSESSION-CHANGE* the house_possession to Sandy_target-possessor}

\ex.\dep{Kim_initial-possessor *kept#POSSESSION-CONT* the house_possession}

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location *went#LOCATION-CHANGE* from Chicago_initial-location via Pittsburgh_transitory-location to Boston_target-location}

\ex.\label{ex:fall}\dep{The vase_has-location *fell#LOCATION-CHANGE* to the ground_target-location}

\ex.\dep{The vase_has-state *broke#STATE-CHANGE*}

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-social-relation *befriended#SOCIAL-RELATION-INIT* Sandy_target-social-relation}

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-social-relation *married#SOCIAL-RELATION-INIT* Sandy_target-social-relation}

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-social-relation *divorced#SOCIAL-RELATION-DEINIT* Sandy_initial-social-relation}

The \fr{SCENE} superframe is often evoked by ``light'' verbs that contribute an aspectual or modal meaning. Thus, its aspectual variants are especially common.

\ex.\dep{The concert_target-scene *began#SCENE-INIT*}

\ex.\dep{The concert_initial-scene *continued#SCENE-CONT*}

\ex.\dep{The concert_initial-scene *finished#SCENE-DEINIT*}

\ex.\dep{The shouting_initial-scene *intensified#SCENE-CONT*}

\ex.\dep{The shouting_initial-scene *faded#SCENE-DEINIT*}

\ex.\dep{A coup_target-scene was *attempted#SCENE-INIT*}

\ex.\dep{Kim_participant *finished#SCENE-DEINIT* their work_initial-scene}

\ex.\dep{Swift action_x-causer *prevented#SCENE-PREV* an outbreak_target-scene}

\ex.\dep{Kim_participant *refrained#SCENE-PREVENTION* from going_target-scene}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *prevented#SCENE-PREV* Sandy_participant from going_target-scene}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *saved#SCENE-PREV* Sandy_participant from the dragon_target-scene}

In the last example, \emph{dragon} is to be understood metonymically as a
scene in which Sandy would have been harmed by the dragon.

In addition, we use the modal suffixes \frs{-NECESSITY} and \frs{-POSSIBILITY}.
They can combine with aspectual suffixes.

\ex.\dep{Change_target-scene is *necessary#SCENE-NECESSITY*}

\ex.\dep{Change_target-scene is *possible#SCENE-POSSIBILITY*}

\ex.\dep{Kim_initial-possessor *owes#POSSESSION-CHANGE-NECESSITY* Sandy_target-possessor money_possessed}

\subsection{Non-core Arguments}

Core arguments always get role labels from the superframe the predicate evokes.
But many verbs have more arguments. One common case is a subject that is
presented as the causer of the scene. For example, compare \ref{ex:throw} with
\ref{ex:fall}. The core scene is the same (same superframe, same arguments). We
now assume there is an additional \fr{CAUSATION} scene with \emph{Kim} as the
\rl{causer} and the core scene as the \rl{result}. We denote this by giving
\emph{Kim} the \rl{causer} role label, with an \rl{x-} prefix to mark it as a
non-core role.

\ex.\label{ex:throw}\dep{Kim_x-causer *threw#LOCATION-CHANGE* the vase_has-location to the ground_target-location}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *broke#STATE-CHANGE* the vase_has-state}

Two other common non-core arguments are the senders and recipients (experiencers) of messages.

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-sender *talked#MESSAGE* to Sandy_x-experiencer about Bali_topic}

Other non-core arguments are usually rather predicate-specific.

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-experiencer *searched#MESSAGE* the woods_x-location for Sandy_topic}

\ex.\dep{Kim_initial-possessor *sold#POSSESSION-CHANGE* Sandy_target-possessor the house_possession for a million dollars_x-asset}

\subsection{Modifiers}

Like non-core arguments, modifiers are assumed to evoke an additional frame,
and labeled with the role they fill in that frame, but with a prefix marking
them as modifiers: \rl{m-}.

\ex.\dep{Kim_excreter is *sweating#EXCRETION* profusely_m-quantity in the sauna_m-location}

\subsection{Nonverbal Predicates}

So far, we have only looked at verbal predicates. But of course, there are
other types of predicates. An ordinary noun like \emph{tree} evokes the
\fr{CLASS} frame, marking the entity it refers to as being a member of a class
(in this case: the class of trees). There are no arguments here because the
predicate itself doubles as a referent. However, the predicate can of course be
modified:

\ex.\dep{a *tree#CLASS* in the garden_m-location}

\ex.\dep{Kim_m-possessor 's *tree#CLASS*}

Event nouns evoke event frames and have arguments:

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer 's *breaking#STATE-CHANGE* of the vase_has-state}

Relational nouns evoke relational frames and have arguments:

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-social-relation 's *friend#SOCIAL-RELATION*}

Pronouns and names evoke the \fr{IDENTIFICATION} frame, meaning that they
identify their referent as some entity (via naming or anaphora resolution).

\ex.\dep{*Kim#IDENTIFICATION*}

\ex.\dep{*they#IDENTIFICATION*}

Predicate adjectives most typically denote states or qualities.

\ex.\dep{I_has-quality am *despicable#QUALITY*}

\ex.\dep{the dog_has-state is *tired#STATE*}

With attributive adjectives, the dependency relation is reversed, and the role label is changed accordingly.

\ex.\dep{despicable_m-quality *me#IDENTIFICATION*}

\ex.\dep{the tired_m-state *dog#CLASS*}

Similarly for adverbs denoting, e.g, manner (\rl{quality}) or extent (\rl{quantity}):

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location *ran#Motion* fast_m-quality}

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location *ran#Motion* far_m-quantity}

\subsection{Control Relations}
\label{sec:control}

\todo[inline]{spell out strategies for consistent detection (xcomp, MESSAGE/SCENE frames, special cases...)}

Many constructions systematically introduce semantic predicate-dependent
dependencies that do not correspond to (surface) syntactic dependencies. In such cases, we add those dependency links.

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location promised Sandy to *come#LOCATION-CHANGE*} (subject control)

\ex.\dep{Kim persuaded Sandy_has-location to *come#LOCATION-CHANGE*} (object control)

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location seemed to *fly#Motion*} (raising)

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-sender entered the room *singing#MESSAGE*} (depictive)

\ex.\dep{You're talking me_has-state *silly#STATE*} (resultative)

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location has come to *stay#LOCATION-CONTINUATION*} (subjectless adverbial clause)

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer left after *trashing#STATE-CHANGE* the room_has-state} (subjectless adverbial clause)

\ex.\dep{Kim_topic is hard to *love#MESSAGE*} (\emph{tough} construction)

\ex.\dep{the song_topic I_x-experiencer *like#MESSAGE*} (relative clause)

\ex.\dep{the question_topic we_x-sender raised without *answering#MESSAGE*} (parasitic gap)

\subsection{Figurativity and Idiomaticity}

Difficulties in choosing frames often arise because a predicate literally evokes
one frame, but is used in a way that perhaps fits another frame equally well or
better. In such cases, annotate both the more literal frame and roles, followed
by the \texttt{>}\texttt{>} operator, followed by the more figurative frame and
roles.

\ex.\dep{A hush_has-location>>scene *passed#LOCATION-CHANGE>>SCENE* over the group_transitory-location>>participant}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-sender>>participant *refused#MESSAGE>>SCENE* to eat_topic>>scene}

This mechanism can be used to indicate that a modification may not be fully compositional:

\ex.\dep{primeval_m-time>>m-noncomp *forest#CLASS*}

\ex.\dep{colored_m-quality>>m-noncomp *pencil#CLASS*}

\ex.\dep{to *lay#LOCATION-CHANGE>>MESSAGE-DEINIT* aside_target-location>>x-noncomp my drawings_has-location>>topic}

\section{Superframes Reference}

\subsection{\fr{SCENE}}
\label{sec:SCENE}

A ``meta'' frame for predicates where the main frame is invoked by \rl{scene},
and the predicate adds some temporal, aspectual, modal, etc., meaning, or just
acts as a light verb. If there is a \rl{participant}, it is assigned a role by
\rl{scene}. In the following examples, we show the annotations for both the
matrix predicate and the embedded predicate in one graph.

\ex.\dep{Kim_participant__is-active *plays#SCENE* **tennis#ACTIVITY**_scene}

\ex.\dep{Kim_participant__participant___is-active *used#SCENE* to **play#SCENE**_scene ***tennis#ACTIVITY***__scene}

\ex.\dep{Kim_participant__x-causer *gave#SCENE* Sandy_participant__hit a **kick#HITTING**_scene}

The modifier relation \rl{m-scene} is used when a syntactic dependeny points
from an argument to a predicate, as, e.g., with relative clauses or sentence
adverbs that are not already covered by a frame such as \fr{MODE} or \fr{FOCUS}.

\ex.\dep{the *clown#CLASS*__topic I__x-experiencer **saw#MESSAGE**_m-scene smiled}

\ex.\dep{**Fortunately#EXPERIENCE**_m-scene for Sandy__experiencer, Kim_has-location is *here#LOCATION*__experienced}

More examples can be found in Section~\ref{sec:aspect-mode}.

\subsection{\fr{IDENTIFICATION}}
\label{sec:IDENTIFICATION}

\rl{identifier} identifies \rl{identified}.

Evoked by pronouns, names, and other identifiers, as well as predicates
denoting naming relationships.

\ex.\dep{*I#IDENTIFICATION* saw a picture}

\ex.\dep{I can distinguish *China#IDENTIFICATION* from Arizona}

\ex.\dep{a book_identified *called#IDENTIFICATION* True Stories_identifier from Nature}

\ex.\dep{This_identified is *Kim#IDENTIFICATION*}

Predicates that evoke other frames can still use \rl{x-identified} to mark the
copula subject as identified:

\ex.\dep{This_x-identified is the *book#MESSAGE* I like_m-scene}

\subsection{\fr{ORDER}}
\label{sec:ORDER}

\rl{order} indicates the order that \rl{has-order} has in some sequence.

\ex.\dep{*Chapter#MESSAGE* 1_m-order}

\ex.\dep{my_m-sender first_m-order *drawing#MESSAGE*}

\subsection{\fr{CLASS}}
\label{sec:CLASS}

\rl{class} indicates the class of entity that \rl{has-class} represents.

Most prototypically evoked by common nouns with no arguments.

\ex.\dep{swallowing an animal#CLASS}

\subsection{\fr{EXISTENCE}}
\label{sec:EXISTENCE}

\rl{exists} exists. Use this only for non-scene entities; for scenes, use the \fr{SCENE} frame.

\ex.\dep{I_exists *exist#EXISTENCE*}

\ex.\dep{There_x-expletive *is#EXISTENCE* a hill_exists}

\ex.\dep{There_x-expletive *is#SCENE* a hubbub_scene}

\subsection{\fr{TRANSFORMATION-CREATION}}
\label{sec:TRANSFORMATION-CREATION}

Special case of \fr{EXISTENCE-INIT} where rl{created} (aka \rl{target-exists})
is newly created from \rl{material}, or \rl{material} is transformed to become
\rl{created}.

\ex.\dep{I_x-causer succeeded in *making#Transformation-Creation* my first drawing_created}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *built#Transformation-Creation* a castle_created out of sand_material}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *turned#Transformation-Creation* straw_material into gold_created}

\subsection{\fr{REPRODUCTION}}
\label{sec:REPRODUCTION}

Special case of \fr{EXISTENCE-INIT} where \rl{original} continues to exist, and
a (modified) \rl{copy} (aka \rl{target-exists}) comes into existence.

\ex.\dep{Here is a *copy#Reproduction* of the drawing_original}

\ex.\dep{This_copy is a *translation#Reproduction* of the pamphlet_original into English_x-quality}

\subsection{\fr{QUALITY}}
\label{sec:QUALITY}

\rl{quality} indicates a (permanent) quality/property/manner of \rl{has-quality}.

\ex.\dep{when I_has-quality was six years_x-quantity *old#QUALITY*}

\ex.\dep{a magnificent_m-quality *picture#MESSAGE*}

\ex.\dep{I_x-experiencer *pondered#MESSAGE* deeply_m-quality over the adventures_topic of the jungle}

\subsection{\fr{STATE}}
\label{sec:STATE}

\rl{state} indicates a (temporary) state of \rl{has-state}.

\ex.\dep{Boa constrictors swallow their prey_has-state *whole#STATE*}

\ex.\dep{they_has-state *sleep#STATE*}

\ex.\dep{they_x-causer swallow their prey whole without *chewing#STATE-CHANGE* it_has-state}

\ex.\dep{the six months that they_x-causer need for *digestion#STATE-CHANGE*}

\ex.\dep{And that_x-causer hasn't much *improved#STATE-CHANGE* my opinion_has-state of them}

\subsection{\fr{DESTRUCTION}}
\label{sec:DESTRUCTION}

Special case of \fr{STATE-CHANGE} where \rl{destroyed} (aka \rl{has-state}) goes out of existence.

\ex.\dep{Sam_destroyed 's *death#Destruction*}

\ex.\dep{Sam_x-causer 's *destruction#Destruction* of the city}

\subsection{\fr{EXPERIENCE}}
\label{sec:EXPERIENCE}

\rl{experienced} indicates an experience that \rl{experiencer} undergoes.

Used for dynamic scenes where the \rl{experiencer} is not necessarily active,
and that cannot well be framed as a state change. Also used for sensory and
mental perception, addressees in communication, beneficiaries, and for ``bystander'' roles.

\ex.\dep{Kim_experiencer 's *adventures#EXPERIENCE* in the jungle_m-location}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *attacked#EXPERIENCE* Sandy_experiencer}

\ex.\dep{I_x-experiencer *saw#MESSAGE* a magnificent picture_topic}

\ex.\dep{I_x-experiencer *pondered#MESSAGE* deeply_m-quality}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-sender *talked#MESSAGE* to Sandy_x-experiencer}

\ex.\dep{Kim_participant *did#SCENE* something_scene nice for Sandy_m-experiencer}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-experiencer cooked a meal only to *have#SCENE* Sandy_participant spurn_scene it}

\ex.\dep{Kim_experiencer *managed#EXPERIENCE* with dealing_experienced the cards}

\ex.\dep{Die Piroggen_participant waren Maria_x-experiencer zu dunkel_target-scene *geraten#SCENE-INIT*}

\ex.\dep{Das_experienced hat_x-noncomp mir_experiencer gerade_x-noncomp noch_x-noncomp *gefehlt#EXPERIENCE*}

For more uses, see \fr{MESSAGE} (Section~\ref{sec:MESSAGE}).

\subsection{\fr{ACTIVITY}}
\label{sec:ACTIVITY}

\rl{is-active} actively participates in \rl{activity}.

Used for dynamic scenes where \rl{is-active} has agency and that cannot well be
framed as a state change.

\ex.\dep{Kim_is-active *worked#ACTIVITY*}

\ex.\dep{Kim_is-active *partied#ACTIVITY*}

\ex.\dep{Kim_is-active had *sex#ACTIVITY*}

\ex.\dep{after some *work#ACTIVITY* with a colored pencil_m-means}

\ex.\dep{I_is-active devoted myself to *geography#ACTIVITY*}

\subsection{\fr{MODE}}

\ex.\dep{The veggies_accompanied *come#ACCOMPANIMENT* with rice_accompanier}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *added#ACCOMPANIMENT-INIT* rice_accompanier to the veggies_accompanied}

\ex.\dep{Rolling thunder_accompanier *accompanies#ACCOMPANIMENT* the rain_accompanied}

Often, the accompanier denotes not the accompanying scene but an entity
participating in it, and must be metonymically understood as the scene.

\ex.\dep{Kim *cycled#LOCATION-CHANGE* to Rome_target-location with Sandy_m-accompanier}

\ex.\dep{Kim_is-active *danced#ACTIVITY* with Sandy_x-accompanier}

\ex.\dep{Kim_participant *had#SCENE* sex_scene with Sandy_x-accompanier}

\subsection{\fr{ATTRIBUTE}}
\label{sec:ATTRIBUTE}

In a scene \rl{has-attribute}, \rl{attribute} is the part or attribute of one or more participants that is most directly involved in the scene.

\ex.\dep{Kim_compared__has-quality *exceeds#COMPARISON* Sandy_reference__has-quality in **height#QUALITY**_x-attribute}

\ex.\dep{Die Qualität_result ist der Motivation_causer *geschuldet#CAUSATION*}

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location *went#LOCATION-CHANGE* to town_target-location because they wanted_m-causer to buy food}

Note how the last example expresses a purpose, but expresses it as a cause, so
\rl{m-causer} lis the right label to use. Compare this to construal as a
purpose:

\label{sec:RESULTATIVE}

Special case of \fr{CAUSATION} where \rl{resultative} (aka \rl{result}) assigns
an argument of \rl{has-resultative} (aka \rl{causer}) a role. We treat the
English resultative construction as a valency-changing operation that adds one
or two arguments to the matrix predicate, so we use \rl{x-resultative} rather
than \rl{m-resultative}.

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *hammered#HITTING* the metal_hit__has-state **flat#STATE**_x-resultative}

\ex.\dep{Kim_experiencer *sneezed#EXPERIENCE* the napkin_x-resultative__x-has-location off the **table#CLASS**_x-resultative}

\subsection{\fr{TIME}}
\label{sec:TIME}

\rl{time} indicates when, how often, or for how long \rl{has-time} takes place. Also evoked by time expressions without arguments.

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location *swims#UNANCHORED-MOTION* on Monday_m-time}

\ex.\dep{Kim_experiencer *sneezed#EXPERIENCE* twice_m-time}

\ex.\dep{Kim_destroyed *kicked#DESTRUCTION* the bucket_x-noncomp}

\ex.\dep{It_x-noncomp is *raining#STATE*}

\ex.\dep{I_x-sender *address#MESSAGE* myself_x-noncomp to you_x-experiencer}

\ex.\dep{There_x-noncomp *was#SCENE* a famine_scene}

Light verbs, on the other hand, are treated with \fr{SCENE}, see Section~\ref{sec:SCENE}.

\section{Memos}

\subsection{Prefer Core over Non-core Arguments}

When an argument fills both a core and a non-core role, it is more important to
annotate the former.

\ex.\dep{Kim_has-location *drove#LOCATION-CHANGE* to Boston_target-location}

\ex.\dep{Kim_x-causer *drove#LOCATION-CHANGE* the car_has-location to Boston_target-location}

\subsection{Arguments Determine Frames}

The most important criterion in choosing a frame for a predicate is that there
should be suitable roles for the predicate's arguments, even if they are
unrealized in the annotated instance. For example, while \emph{drawing} denotes
a \fr{CLASS} of things, it can occur with a prepositional argument denoting a
\rl{topic}, so \fr{MESSAGE} is a better choice.

\ex.\dep{my_m-sender first_m-order *drawing#MESSAGE*}

\subsection{Participant Nouns}

Some nouns denote a person who participates in a specific type of scene in a
specific type of role. In such cases, use the most appropriate frame for that
scene. For example, in a narrative where the narrator has just been criticized
by a stranger, you could annotate as follows:

\ex.\dep{With that, my_topic *critic#MESSAGE* sat down again}

In other cases, such nouns rather denote a person's profession or expertise or
their role in a social context:

\ex.\dep{He_has-class is a *teacher#CLASS*}

\ex.\dep{She_has-social-relation is the *president#SOCIAL-RELATION* of our club_social-relation}

\subsection{Particle Verbs}

In UD, particle verbs are connected to their particle via the
\texttt{compound:prt} relation. If the meaning is spatial, this dependency is
labeled with \rl{initial-location} or \rl{target-location}.

\ex.\dep{*get#LOCATION-DEINIT* the lid_has-location off_initial-location}

\ex.\dep{You_has-location may *go#LOCATION-INIT* in_target-location now_m-time}

In semi-non-compositional particle verbs, where the particle adds a partially predictable
but nonspatial meaning to the verb, use an appropriate role, e.g.,
\rl{x-marker} if the meaning is aspectual.

\ex.\dep{*eat#INGESTION* up_x-marker the cookies_ingested} (implies \emph{eat} the cookies)

In fully non-compositional particle verbs, where the meaning is not
predictable, use \rl{x-noncomp}.

\ex.\dep{*do#EXPERIENCE* somebody_experiencer in_x-noncomp} (does not imply \emph{do} somebody)

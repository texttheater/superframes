Changes for Superframes v2
==========================

Changes in annotation targets
-----------------------------

* label also dislocated edges

Changes for aspect, mode annotation
-----------------------------------

* only DYN-, MOD-; no further distinctions

Changes in frame inventory
--------------------------

* abolish DEPICTIVE; add non-local dependency to mark an argument as depictive.
  Use accompanier by default.
* rename LOCATION to POSITION? (to include orientation)
* merge STATE and QUALITY into ISOQ (internal state or quality)
* add SUBCLASS frame for hyponymy
* abolish UNANCHORED-MOTION, use POSITION-DYN
* (rethink POSSESSION and SOCIAL-RELATION, perhaps add GROUP-MEMBERSHIP)
* rename SCENE to META
* abolish MODE, replace with META-MOD
* add FOCUS
* division into basic and advanced frames: advanced ones always have at least
  one scene argument. Advanced: ASSET, ATTRIBUTE, EXPERIENCE, EXPLANATION,
  MEANS, MESSAGE, META, FOCUS, NONCOMP, SEQUENCE, TIME
* possibly abolish arg2 role of IDENTIFICATION, QUANTITY, RANK, CLASS, ISOQ,
  FOCUS, TIME

Changes in role labels
----------------------

* abolish x- m- prefixes; distinction between core arguments on the one hand and
  non-core arguments and modifiers on the other will be implicit via the frame
  label. The guideline to prefer core arguments remains. Rename core/non-core to
  internal/external
* introduce a new type of role label: reversed. E.g., scene-in, location-in.

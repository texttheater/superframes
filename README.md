Superframes
===========

Superframes is an annotation scheme for semantic roles. Like other such
schemes, it is essentially about pinning down, in a machine-readable form, “who
did what to whom”. It is different from other such schemes, such as FrameNet,
VerbNet, PropBank, VerbAtlas, or WiSER in a number of ways. It aims to avoid a
number of practical problems in annotating with those schemes. Find out more in
the [annotation
manual](https://github.com/texttheater/superframes/blob/main/doc/manual/manual.pdf).
